# Bee-Colony-Meta-Heuristic-for-MDVRP-
Using Bee colony meta heuristics to solve capacitated multi-depot vehicle routing problem. 
This project shows the implementation of the algorithm. 
A rebuilt visual C++ version based on Eigen3 will be released soon.  
Note that: C++ with Eigen3 is approximately 20 - 30 times faster than Python with Numpy.
