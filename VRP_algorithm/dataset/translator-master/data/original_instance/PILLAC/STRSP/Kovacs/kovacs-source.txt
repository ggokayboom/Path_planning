STRSP instances

The instances are based on those of Solomon for the VRPTW 
http://w.cba.neu.edu/~msolomon/problems.htm 
and those of the ROADF challenge 2007 http://www.g-scop.inpg.fr/ChallengeROADEF2007/. 
In addition to time windows and service times, 
for each task (or customer) a cost term and a skill-level requirement matrix has been generated. 
The entry d12 refers to skill 1 and level 2. In the results that will be made available soon, 
capacity and demand are not used and instead of the cost terms given in the instance files, 
for each task outsourcing costs are calculatd as follows:
200 + (d11 + d12 + ... + dnm)^1.5
where n gives the total number of skills and m the total number of levels.
